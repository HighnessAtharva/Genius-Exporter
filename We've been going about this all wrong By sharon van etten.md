 ## Darkness Fades
Darkness Fades LyricsRain, sleep tonight
Sunrise, hold hands all night

It's been a while since I held you close
Been a while since we’ve touched
All the doors close
I've seen the fall
I've seen you undone
Been writing on the dust
I’m hearing stars fall
Keeping what at bay?
Here I'm standing, partly here
Here, I stare around the room
Pray home they

I'm looking at our grass
I'm struggling for words
I'm dreaming of a place
I held close in a state
Darkness fades

The nights are now
Better stay, light
I'm looking for a way
Darkness fadesEmbed
#### Been writing on the dust
```ANNOTATION:```
>A reference, says [Laura Snapes in their Pitchfork review](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sharon-van-etten-weve-been-going-about-this-all-wrong/), "to the wildfire ashes that caked her car in the driveway."  The image also evokes the "ashes to ashes, dust to dust" of the funeral service, and perhaps Christ writing in the dust to save the woman taken in adultery ([John 8, 3-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208%3A3-11&version=KJV)).

 ## Home to Me
Home to Me LyricsThe only child
Don't turn your back, don't leave
You're on my mind
Do you not see?

I need my job
Please don't hold that against me
You are my life
Ooh, don't that sting?

Oh, my child
You throw it back to me
You hold my time
You hold right back indeed
I take my time
So you can say to me
"What makes it right
Is an unknown thing"

You come home to me
You come home to me
You come home to me
You come home to me
You come home to me
You come home to meEmbed

 ## I’ll Try
I’ll Try LyricsMy hell in drive
My heart in, like, a fog
I hear them now
Every time I cross the park

Believe the death
Karma, your life
Come what fear undone
My life on the path

Don't state a direction
Like who my blood won't save
Anyone on a mission
To fear a life, no love
It crossed my mind I'd try
Let's go march, I'll go downtown
Wear my protection by ways no one can judge
The lack of conviction, change the ways of the number one

I'll try
I'll try
I'll try
I'll try

Worldwide intervention on the "do not touch"
It's too much, but I'll try
I'll try
Cross my heart
Cross my heart
I'llEmbed

 ## Anything
Anything LyricsUp the whole night, undefined
Can't stop thinking about peace and war
Up the whole night, right before
The sun takes everything
It could've been anything
I didn't feel anything

Up the whole night, underline
Chain-smoking, like, no, it ain't right
Afternoon beer? Understate
It could've been anything
It could've been anything
I didn't feel anything
You love him by the stove light in your arms
He is there because he can't stand the sad eyes

I couldn't feel anything
I couldn't feel anything
I couldn't feel anything
I couldn't feel anything
I couldn't feel anythingEmbed

 ## Born
Born Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was never like her
I laugh as I am knocked down
Turned your face like I always did
When I was taking my time

[Pre-Chorus]
I knew where I was born
I knew where I was blamed by the world

[Chorus]
Where have you been?
You were with your wishes
What could have been
If a wish was kisses
[Verse 2]
One night I walked into a situation
That I could have avoided
But it turned into something
My babe noticed "ain't right"

[Pre-Chorus]
It was something like a window
And I wanted to break free
You showed me a false halo
There will be no walking back
I walk away, my head turned

[Chorus]
I wanted to break
Something like an innocent child
Walking by fire
Not another bullet in vainEmbed
#### If a wish was kisses
```ANNOTATION:```
>Suggesting the old [Perry Como song](https://genius.com/Perry-como-if-wishes-were-kisses-lyrics): "If wishes were kisses, I'd still be kissing you."

 ## Headspace
Headspace Lyrics[Verse 1]
Eyes on screen to left of me
All the clouds are wrapped around your brain
Hardly see what's next to you
Can't you see I'm trying to get through?

[Chorus]
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby
[Verse 2]
I want to touch you in the dark
Put lips on neck to me
Hold yourself up against me
Don't stop
Pull my hips, remind you, see
Ten-year old white cotton briefs want to play

[Chorus]
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby

[Bridge]
I wanted to feel ageless
I wanted to be here
I wanted to feel ageless
I wantеd to feel here

[Outro]
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to mе
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me

 ## Come Back
Come Back Lyrics[Verse]
Wall eyes
Ceiling felt too high
Nights were falling down skies
Was no look in the eyes
Subtle moments of past
What a wondering time
Come back

[Pre- Chorus]
Swallowed over the stage
Turning into the rage
Wondering what forced the age
Towards tomorrow
[Chorus]
Come back
Come back
Was wild and unsure
And naked and pure
Come back

[Pre- Chorus]
Turning into the fear
Never something was here
Turning over my mind
Jumping on tenuous time

[Chorus]
Come back
Come back
Moments of faith
Turning out late
Come back

[Pre- Chorus]
Leaning over the stairs
Trying to see what's there
Or does anyone care?
Ominous state
[Chorus]
Come back
Come back
Neighboring love
Won't stay in the home
Come back

[Outro]
Come back
Come back
Moments of fire
Can turn the car on back homeEmbed

 ## Darkish
Darkish LyricsTurn me back and you'll say
"Here is what you have
Only in the stars you saw
Harmony is all you see
And home is what you hold
And what you have to hold
Is what you wanted"

"Cruel," he said, once
It's always once
All is harmony
Just once, it's all, it's done
And crazy as can be
It's not dark, it's only darkish
Waiting

Tell me this one thing
Calling out to where
Where will we be when our world is done?
It's done

Darkish inside of meEmbed

 ## Mistakes
Mistakes Lyrics[Verse 1]
I walk down the road
Let my body wake up by the way
You move
Skate around the room
See my body ache, my body shake
Boom boom

[Chorus]
Even when I make a mistake
Even when I make a mistake mistake mistake
It's much better than that
[Verse 2]
I dance like Elaine
But my baby takes me to the floor
Says 'more more'
Eyes close to stares
My baby takes, my body shares
Lights flare

[Chorus]
Even when I make a mistake
Even when I make a mistake mistake mistake
It's much better than that

[Hook]
When I make a mistake
Turns out it's great, it's great, it's great
I'm much better than that
It's much better than that

[Synth Instrumental]

[Outro]
Even when I make a mistake
Even when I make a mistake mistake
Turns out great
Even when you're late, you're late, you're late
It's much better than that
It's much better than that
It's much better than thatEmbed
#### I dance like Elaine

 ## Far Away
Far Away LyricsBeen down on myself
Said won't go back
Been there
My mother might say you were right

Doesn't matter where she is (not far)
I'll be here for a little while
Then not gone (long)
Don't know what it is so far
I'll be here
Not only when you feel long lost
Sitting there
Wet mess
We held till the sun came up
Are you aware last steps realize?

Doesn't matter where she is (not far)
I'll be here for a little while
Then not gone (long)
Don't know what it is so far
I'll be here
Not only when you feel long lost

Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away

Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away1Embed
