Rather than interviewing people I came up with the idea of writing a series of questions on cards. The cards would be in a stack on a conductors stand in front of a mike. We would scour Abbey Road Studios for willing guinea pigs, bring them to the studio, sit them down, roll tape and then ask them to respond to each card in order.\n\nAs I recall the first card was something irrelevant and innocuous, like \u201cWhat\u2019s your favourite colour?\u201d and the last was the more enigmatic \u201cWhat do you think of The Dark Side Of The Moon?\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t remember the ones in between, except for:\nAre you afraid of dying?\nWhen were you last violent?\nWere you in the right?\nDo you ever think you\u2019re going mad?\nIf so why?\nEnd of Story.\u201dEmbed"
