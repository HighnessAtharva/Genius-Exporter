 ## Brianstorm
Brianstorm Lyrics[Verse 1]
Brian, top marks for not trying
So kind of you to bless us with your effortlessness
We're grateful and so strangely comforted
And I wonder, are you putting us under?
'Cause we can't take our eyes off the t-shirt and ties combination
Well, see you later, innovator

[Verse 2]
Some want to kiss, some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get, 'cause you're smooth and you're wet
And she's not aware yet, but she's yours
She'll be saying, "Use me, show me the jacuzzi"
I imagine that it's there on a plate, your whole rendezvous rate
Means that you'll never be frightened to make 'em wait for a while
[Bridge]
I doubt it's your style not to get what you set out to acquire
The eyes are on fire, you are the unforecasted storm

[Verse 3]
(Brian) Calm, collected and commanding
(Top marks for not trying) You leave the other story standing
With your renditions and jokes, bet there's hundreds of blokes
That have wept 'cause you've stolen their thunder
Are you putting us under?
'Cause we can't take our eyes off the t-shirt and ties combination
Well, see you later, innovator54Embed
#### You leave the other story standing
```ANNOTATION:```
>One night stands he has never actually develop to anything further, instead it seems to be a rinse and repeat for him. There could be potential for the relationships, yet he has no care to do it and instead would rather judge a book by its cover, take it out, flip through the pages and put it back to get another one.



#### Calm, collected and commanding
```ANNOTATION:```
>He is apathetic despite the confrontations his flings may impose on him, yet seems to have the ability to diffuse them as he seems to be a domineering person when someone tries to criticise him. They would be good traits, however he twists them in a narcissistic way that only benefits him and probably makes the situations worse over time instead of improving them.
The alliteration may add a tone of a pacifist's nature, yet it is very clear it is not. (Irony!)



#### Top marks for not trying
```ANNOTATION:```
>There's irony. Brian is so uncaring that it might as well be awarded, as it is almost a talent to how poor the effort he gives in is.
He doesn't have any sympathy, apathetic for the people he hurts. With the mass of flings and one-nighters he appears to have had, yet none of them actually being a real relationship or even an acquaintance. Still, despite his little attempts, he may want some sort of award or gratification as he could be a narcissist - and it's very likely he is one. 

Men like this in society are often praised for their womaniser nature among the men but hated by women, so he will get some form of award yet a lot of negativity as gossip does grow.



#### With your renditions and jokes, bet there’s hundreds of blokes
 That have wept ’cause you’ve stolen their thunder
```ANNOTATION:```
>Alex here, sings about the fabled 'Brian' who clearly left an impression on the band. He simply means 'Brian' is so smooth with his charm and funny "jokes" that he leaves all other men in the vicinity with little chance at scoring a woman to spend the night with due to his irresistible  *je ne sais qoui*.



#### I doubt it’s your style not to get what you set out to acquire
 The eyes are on fire, you are the unforecasted storm
```ANNOTATION:```
>This may be alluding to the fact that while that "Brian" is usually cool calm and collected, he has he's bursts of passion, perhaps specifically when he decide to well "acquire" something, or most likely someone, he has solid determination and acts in a way many are surprised by. Showing even he gets hellbent on people sometimes. Could be he is used to easily get who and what he wants that he can't stand being rejected.



#### And she’s not aware yet, but she’s yours
 She’ll be saying, “Use me, show me the jacuzzi”
```ANNOTATION:```
>The girl he's spotted isn't even aware of him yet, but Brian's charms are so irresistible that Alex can already say with certainty that she will soon be begging to go home with him. 

The description of Brian as a guy with a jacuzzi that he uses to have sex with women in adds to his image as a bit of a stereotypical sleazeball.



#### I imagine that it’s there on a plate, your whole rendezvous rate
 Means that you’ll never be frightened to make ’em wait for a while
```ANNOTATION:```
>Brian has very regular sexual encounters with women (he has a high "rendezvous rate") due to his effortless charm, so he never comes across as needy or overly eager with any one woman. He's not worried that she'll lose interest while waiting for him, because he knows she won't, and even if she does, there will be plenty more women ready to quickly take her place.



#### So kind of you to bless us with your effortlessness
 We’re grateful and so strangely comforted
```ANNOTATION:```
>In a half-sarcastic, half-serious tone, Alex appreciates the presence of Brian, since he always woos people when he's in the room.



#### There’s not a net you couldn’t slip through
 Or at least that’s the impression I get, ’cause you’re smooth and you’re wet
```ANNOTATION:```
>Brian is slimy and able to talk his way out of tough situations - even when former flings confront him, he manages to slip out of trouble. Describing him as wet could also be an insult - he has no backbone.



#### Some want to kiss, some want to kick you
```ANNOTATION:```
>Lots of people love Brian for his baddassness, but there will always be haters. Plus, the girls that wanted to kiss him in the past might want to kick him now after becoming [one night stands](http://rock.rapgenius.com/Arctic-monkeys-leave-before-the-lights-come-on-lyrics).

 ## Teddy Picker
Teddy Picker Lyrics[Verse 1]
They've sped up to the point where they provoke
The punchline before they have told the joke
Plenty of desperation to be seen
Staring at the television screen
They've sped up to the point where they provoke
You to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
Well sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
It wasn't in the Top 100 list

[Chorus]
And it's the thousandth time that it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told you, but you were dying for it
[Post-Chorus]
She saw it and she grabbed it and it wasn't what it seemed
The kids all dream of making it, whatever that means

[Verse 2]
Another variation on a theme
A tangle on the television and the magazine
D'you reckon that they do it for a joke?
D'you reckon that they make 'em take an oath
That says that "We are defenders of any poser
Or professional pretender around"

[Chorus]
And when did your list replace the twist and turn
Like a fist replaced a kiss?
Don't concern us with your bollocks, I don't want your prayer
Save it for the morning after

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
And it's the thousandth time that it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told you, but you were gagging for it

[Bridge]
Let's have a game on the teddy picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick and you're getting thicker
Let's have a game on the teddy picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick and you're getting thicker
[Outro]
Presuming that all things are equal
Who'd want to be men of the people
When there's people like you?49Embed
#### A tangle on the television and the magazine
```ANNOTATION:```
>Teddy Picker is an idiomatic song for the phrase “be careful what you wish for,” and things similar to that. This especially relates to fame. I believe this line is referring to what happens behind the scenes, especially from the media and other narratives. What happens on television may not be what is being directed. Same goes for magazines and all media nowadays. A tangle can refer to an argument of some sort. Essentially, the toxicity that happens behind the scenes.



#### Like a fist replaced a kiss?
```ANNOTATION:```
>This is Alex alluding to how the music industry tends to standardize itself, especially in popular music. Essentially, Alex is arguing that replacing the sort of unpredictable nature of song writing with a formula is as shocking and distasteful as being punched in the lip when you expected a soft kiss. 



#### They’ve sped up to the point where they provoke
 You to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
```ANNOTATION:```
>By taking out the funniest part of the joke, the joke becomes useless and is no longer funny. Similarly, some people in the music industry have taken away the best part of the whole process of creating music: the shortcuts tarnish the art of music and remove its value.



#### Presuming that all things are equal
```ANNOTATION:```
>People are always saying all things are equal, so if they are who would want to be a man of people and stand for the people if everyone is as shallow and foolish as the people in the music industry. 
He is highlighting that they are an awful group of people and that they probably aren't equal to everyone else, they are rock bottom and he doesn't want to bee involved with people as terrible as the idiots in the music industry.



#### Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
 Already thick and you’re getting thicker
```ANNOTATION:```
>Trying to crack the music industry is like playing a game on a teddy picker, it's unlikely you will get anything out of it, but you still keep trying. They are in denial that it's their own fault and are convinced that if they machine was quicker they will win. Clearly this will not help, hence already thick and you getting thicker. They were already fools for thinking they could win it and they look like bigger idiots the more they persist.



#### And it’s the thousandth time that it’s even bolder
 Don’t be surprised when you get bent over
 They told you, but you were gagging for it
```ANNOTATION:```
>People trying to crack the music industry are constantly let down. They have people telling them to do this and do that and they will become famous but it never happens.



#### Don’t concern us with your bollocks, I don’t want your prayer
```ANNOTATION:```
>He doesn't want to be a part of the media circus and is rejecting all the propaganda that surrounds the music industry. He doesn't want their praise or their approval because they are full of rubbish.



#### And when did your list replace the twist and turn
```ANNOTATION:```
>Alex could be referring to 'top ten countdowns' and 'top 100 hottest new artists' and all the other lists produced by the media. He's asking why it's more important that you are in the top ten for this and that than to actually be growing and changing as a musician and embarking on an adventure to crack the music industry. He's trying to say the journey to make the music is more important then anyone's rubbish list. 
This line can also link back to the title of the song and the running ideology surrounding the teddy picker as the *"twist and turn"* may be related to the movement of a teddy picker.



#### D’you reckon that they do it for a joke?
 D’you reckon that they make ’em take an oath
 That says that ”We are defenders of any poser
 Or professional pretender around”
```ANNOTATION:```
>Alex is confused as to why all the managers and agents and talent scouts and so forth even bother because in the end they are just helping rubbish artists get nowhere. He is making fun of these types of people in the music industry and the people they promote, asking if they have taken an oath to defend all the talentless hacks and desperate posers.



#### Another variation on a theme
```ANNOTATION:```
>All this music is the same in essence; they are just repeated the same old song with slight differences. It's processed and lacks personality and individuality.

 ## D is for Dangerous
D is for Dangerous Lyrics[Verse 1]
He knew what he wanted to say
But he didn't know how to word it
The dirty little Herbert was seeking an escape
But the place was well-guarded
The guiltiness that started
Soon as the other part had stopped

[Chorus]
'D' is for delightful and try and keep your trousers on
I think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare
[Verse 2]
'D' is for desperately trying to simulate
What it was that was alright
Three quarters of an hour ago
That had led him to be in a position
On the brink of a mission
On the brink of an episode

[Bridge]
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel—I think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare

[Chorus]
'D' is for delightful and try and keep your trousers on
You should know you're his favourite worst nightmare20Embed
#### The dirty little Herbert was seeking an escape
 But the place was well-guarded
```ANNOTATION:```
>Well, at first sight, this sounds as if the narrator is sexually aroused (you must know what "little Herbert" stands for) and he´s trying to hide it. However, this could simply mean desire or excitement. He´s talking about a very strong feeling that comes when the person he fancies is around him. When this happens, he tries to contain himself, but it´s a tough job. This could also explain why this person is his "favourite worst nightmare". He enjoys their presence but it makes him nervous, added to other annoying things this character continuely brings to the table.



#### ‘D’ is for delightful
```ANNOTATION:```
>Turner uses words starting with D to describe this female, who is the 'favourite worst nightmare' of some. He starts off with 'delightful', because it is the first impression she gives to people - something we later find out to be verging on charming and flirtatious.



#### You should know you’re his favourite worst nightmare
```ANNOTATION:```
>This one is different, instead of saying I think you should know, they just state it as a fact. This is saying that the person is for sure a nightmare to the person, but they cant help loving them.



#### —I think you should know you’re his favourite worst nightmare
```ANNOTATION:```
>Alex loves the madness of this girl, but she is a nightmare to deal with. 

This line inspired the name of the album, not the other way around. While what became *FWN* was being recorded, *Lesbian Wednesdays*, *Gordon Brown*, and *Gary Barlow* were considered possible album titles.



#### A parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
```ANNOTATION:```
>Essentially, if their partner was easier to talk to, like they might be in a parallel universe, then it would be perfect, and they wouldn't be a nightmare to deal with. He dreams of an easy relationship with her, and a life where things go well for him, overall.

It could also mean that after this whole conversation, when he tried to confess his love/feeling and trying to say what he really meant the girl whom he's talking to gets it all wrong and perhaps gets angry, so he wishes he had another chance and do it all over again, like in a parallel universe.



#### ‘D’ is for desperately trying to simulate
 What it was that was alright
 Three quarters of an hour ago
```ANNOTATION:```
>Also referring to the basics. He is talking about how some people are always bringing up things that they said were okay, but they now have a reason that it is not.

 ## Balaclava
Balaclava Lyrics[Verse 1]
Running off over next door's garden before the hour is done
It's more a question of feeling than it is a question of fun
The confidence is the balaclava, I'm sure you'll baffle 'em good
Will the ending reek of salty cheeks and runny makeup alone?
Or will blood run down the face of a boy bewildered and scorned
And you'll find yourself in a skirmish where you wish you'd never been born?
You tie yourself to the tracks and there isn't no going back
And it's wrong, wrong, wrong, but we'll do it anyway 'cause we love a bit of trouble

[Verse 2]
Are you pulling her from a burning building or throwing her to the sharks?
Can only hope that the ending is as pleasurable as the start
The confidence is the balaclava, I'm sure you'll baffle 'em straight
And it's wrong, wrong, wrong, but she can hardly wait
[Chorus]
That's right, he won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform and the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime?
That's right, he won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform and the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime?

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
That's right, he won't let her out his sight
That's right, he won't let her out his sight
That's right, he won't let her out his sight
Well, you'll be able to boast
Of the day of the most flawless heist of all time

[Outro]
You knew that it'd be trouble right before the very first kiss
Quiet and unassuming but you heard that they were the naughtiest
She pleaded with you to take it off but you resisted and fought
But sorry, sweetheart, I'd much rather keep on the balaclava26Embed
#### That’s right, he won’t let her out his sight
```ANNOTATION:```
>This line is synonymous with the phrase "keep your eyes on the prize". Using the metaphor of a robbery, we can compare the individual in this song to a thief that has his eyes on a single diamond. He risks his freedom and perhaps even his life for that one diamond because he knows that to him, it's worth it; and so the person described here has his eyes set on this girl because even though he knows what he's doing is wrong, she's worth every minute of it.



#### That’s right, he won’t let her out his sight
 That’s right, he won’t let her out his sight
 That’s right, he won’t let her out his sight
```ANNOTATION:```
>Now that her boyfreind knows about the affair he hasn't dumped her but he won't let her see anyone else and always checks up on her he's now being possesive, relating back to an earlier line where now he has "thrown her to the sharks" made her life worse rather than better.



#### Now the shaggers perform and the daggers are drawn
 Who’s the crooks in this crime?
```ANNOTATION:```
>Now the two have robbed the place/had sex and "climaxed." "Now the daggers are drawn has 3 meanings.':

1) A play on sex, like how you take out your genitals to get down.

2) The daggers are drawn literally and now they are in a skirmish with the law or the people they tried to rob.

3) The daggers are the truth and they are now bearing their truths out to each other in a big fight.



#### Well, you’ll be able to boast
 Of the day of the most flawless heist of all time
```ANNOTATION:```
>A heist is a robbery with a large amount of loot stolen; perhaps he is saying that despite all the mishaps of the night, it was worth it because he managed to steal her heart and they weren't caught by anyone, most importantly her boyrfriend.



#### She pleaded with you to take it off but you resisted and fought
 But sorry, sweetheart, I’d much rather keep on the balaclava
```ANNOTATION:```
>A balaclava is sort of like a ski mask. 

http://images.rapgenius.com/ca0261b56ce96014d1c93a7ce208210d.885x1000x1.jpg

He doesn't want to show his true feelings to her, even though they've been through so much and she's lost her boyfriend because of the affair. He wasn't looking for love; it was only an attempt to be able to boast. He wants to disappear off, and have other conquests without her.

 ## Fluorescent Adolescent
Fluorescent Adolescent Lyrics[Verse 1]
You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

[Chorus 1]
Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem, aren't as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up
[Verse 2]
Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
Clinging 'till I'm getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

[Chorus 2]
Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem, not as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, Flo, where did you go?
Where did you go? Where did you go?

[Bridge]
You're falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
Just sounding it out
But you're not coming back again
You're falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
You were just sounding it out
But you're not coming back again
[Outro]
You used to get it in your fishnets
(Falling about)
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
(You took a left off Last Laugh Lane)
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
(You were just sounding it out)
Is anything as pretty in the past though?
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
(You're not coming back again)
Remember when you used to be a rascal?
(Oh...)147Embed
#### Remember when you used to be a rascal?
```ANNOTATION:```
>This intro could be about our protagonist duelling it out in her head. She's disappointed with what she's become and yearns for days past, but she misses her glory days but knows she can never go back.



#### Just sounding it out
 But you’re not coming back again
```ANNOTATION:```
>After deciding to go to this event ("said she wasn't going but she went still") she's changed the course of her life. She's taken a "left off last laugh lane" meaning she's exited the life she was currently on to a no-fun boring marriage. When she initially went she justified it to herself by saying she was "just sounding it out", meaning that she was seeing how it was, just feeling it out. However, Alex knows that this is a turning point for her and once she makes this move she isn't going back to her cozy life and (presumed) husband



#### Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
```ANNOTATION:```
>This slight play on words could be a possible reference to a (sexual) innuendo. Whilst in the bedroom or during intercourse, the woman may prefer to play a more 'submissive' role, whilst she prefers her "gentleman" at the time to play a more 'dominant' role. These lines may show the contrast between the man who treats her roughly in the bedroom but gentle elsewhere.



#### Weren’t as daft as they seem, aren’t as daft as they seem
 My love, when you dream them up
```ANNOTATION:```
>In British slang, Daft means foolish or silly. Here he is speaking of a time before the girl’s adventurous life, where she had dreams of said ‘ecstatic sex life’, and he is recalling on those. Alex is saying that looking back, those dreams weren’t as outlandish or foolish as they seemed back then.
Another theory is that he is saying “they weren’t as daft as they seem now” (because of the tense) because it’s an event that has already occurred.



#### Weren’t as daft as they seem, not as daft as they seem

#### Oh, the boy’s a slag, the best you ever had
 The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
```ANNOTATION:```
>In British slang, a "slag" is a sexually promiscuous person. The promiscuity of her ex-lover coupled with the statement that it "is just a memory" is used to portray him as a young man, further cementing the idea that this woman was in her sexual prime when she was younger and misses those times.



#### You’re falling about
 You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
```ANNOTATION:```
>He uses streets as a metaphor for life - she was on Last Laugh Lane, already a pretty dire place, and then she turned off it, meaning there were no more laughs. The high life was probably far behind her and she can't find her way back.



#### That Bloody Mary’s lacking in Tabasco
```ANNOTATION:```
>Life (particularly her sex life) is lacking a bit of spice. Tabasco is a hot sauce used in a 'Bloody Mary' - a popular tomato juice based alcoholic drink to be had the morning after a night of drinking, associated with "hair of the dog" drinking.

#### Everything’s in order in a black hole
 Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
```ANNOTATION:```
>Everything is calm and ok (in physics, a black hole is a perfectly ordered system in the entropic sense) but this calm comes along with a sense of boredom and dread that sucks you in. The woman in the song, as a response to this, looks back to the past in a futile attempt to relive the good times, both in terms of being young and enjoying her sex life again.



#### Oh, Flo, where did you go?
 Where did you go? Where did you go?
```ANNOTATION:```
>In an interview they were asked if this line referred to a girl's time of the month:

>Alex: If you want. It’s whatever you want it to be, you know?

>Matt: It won’t be fluorescent though. If it’s fluorescent you need to go and see a doctor.

>Jamie: We should start doing a surgery thing on the radio—-people ring us up with their problems and we sort it out.

>Nick: If you’ve got fluorescent menstruation, shoot yourself.

 ## Only Ones Who Know
Only Ones Who Know Lyrics[Verse 1]
In a foreign place, the saving grace was the feeling
That it was a heart that he was stealing
Oh, he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
The eyes are bright, he couldn't wait to get away
And I bet that Juliet was just the icing on the cake
Make no mistake, no

[Chorus]
And even if somehow we could have
Shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have
Made it that bit better on your own
[Verse 2]
And I bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
But all the little promises, they don't mean much
When there's memories to be made
And I hope you're holding hands by New Year's Eve
They made it far too easy to believe
That true romance can't be achieved these days

[Chorus]
And even if somehow they could have
Shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have
Made it that bit better on your own
You are the only ones who know38Embed
#### Make no mistake, no
```ANNOTATION:```
>This line is used to preface the rest of the song in the sense that the first verse is one full of descriptions of infatuation and excitement of new love, while the chorus and the second verse are of bitter sweet endings. The point is to show that there’s no regret in the relationship, even if things didn’t work out in the end, the good memories and feelings of immense joy were still worth it, even if they faded away with time. 



#### And even if somehow they could have
 Shown you the place you wanted
 Well, I’m sure you could have
 Made it that bit better on your own
 You are the only ones who know
```ANNOTATION:```
>They are caught up in the *idea* of what they believe the relationship to entail; the fail to see that the reality of the situation - of who they are together - isn't what they each had imagined; it's not the "place they wanted". It's something outsiders may have been able to detect, if the couple were willing to listen. 

Turner suggests that improving their individual lives didn't necessarily depend on getting together. If they really wanted to have a better life, they could each have focused on the things wrong with them, rather than add someone else's problems into the mix.

He finishes off with "you are the only ones who know", as if to say that, despite seeming like the myriad of failed relationships out there, it is unique in its own way, and that he is no one to judge - that is for them to do.



#### And I hope you’re holding hands by New Year’s Eve
```ANNOTATION:```
>The New Year, or New Year's Day, is a universal symbol for new beginnings, regardless of when it is celebrated. It categorically refers to the time in which a culture restarts the calendar in order to renew the circle of life, along with its festivities and traditions. 

The reference to New Year's Eve, therefore, assumes the *end* of the calendar year. The subject is questioning what the couple's stance will be by the end of this phase. 

The term "holding hands" is interesting in its vagueness: it certainly indicates a loss of passion - which one might expect past the initial 'Honeymoon Phase' at the start of any relationship -, but it can even be taken to mean simply getting along, whether or not this entails any romantic feeling. 

Furthermore, the subject's optimism - "I hope" - makes one wonder how likely this outcome is and if the truth is not, in fact, the very opposite: he forces us to weigh out the probabilities of their liking one another - or even *tolerating*, never mind being passionately in love, as they now seem - versus the relationship having turned sour.



#### [Verse 1]
```ANNOTATION:```
>In this verse, he is talking about how the idea of romance and relationships, like the classic play ["Romeo and Juliet"](https://genius.com/albums/William-shakespeare/Romeo-and-juliet), are sold to make us believe that they will give us happiness and validate our worth. When he was feeling unsure and scared, he took comfort in the fact that he was taking part in the chase of a relationship. In doing so, he was winning her over.

In the next few lines however, he reflects that even he knows it’s not about the specific girl he’s with, or “Juliet," it’s about finally having someone to fill in this relationship role he has been taught to desire. This is why he uses the name Juliet as a jane-doe like reference; she is anyone that will play the part and leave him satisfied on the surface.



#### And even if somehow we could have
 Shown you the place you wanted
 Well, I’m sure you could have
 Made it that bit better on your own
```ANNOTATION:```
>I think this line means that even if everything had worked out they way he wanted, it still wouldn't live up to what he has built it up to be in his imagination.



#### That it was a heart that he was stealing
```ANNOTATION:```
>If someone is stealing your heart, it means they are making you fall in love with them. He knows that this girl cared for him and that seemed to make everything worth while.



#### They made it far too easy to believe
 That true romance can’t be achieved these days
```ANNOTATION:```
>Everywhere you go you see couples arguing, bitter Facebook statuses, cheating, lying --you start to wonder where all the love is. Some stop believing in it, thinking true love is just a think of the past only told in stories. But Alex believes that it's out there and he holds this couple as evidence to it.



#### And I bet she told a million people that she’d stay in touch
 But all the little promises, they don’t mean much
 When there’s memories to be made
```ANNOTATION:```
>Often times when a couple first gets together, all they think about is each other. They start to drift apart from all of their other friends. Friendships become distant, and best friends become acquaintances. Of course, she may make plans to 'catch up' with old friends to keep the friendship alive, but she won't really make the effort, because she's happy in her relationship and can do without friends.



#### And I bet that Juliet was just the icing on the cake
```ANNOTATION:```
>The name "Juliet" is a reference to [Shakespeare](/artists/william-shakespeare)'s 1595 play [Romeo and Juliet](https://genius.com/albums/William-shakespeare/Romeo-and-juliet). The aspect of the Shakespeare-esque forbidden love only made it even more thrilling for Alex, an ["icing on the cake"](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/icing+on+the+cake). Alex was more excited by the idea of love than the girl, who already had a boyfriend.

#### Oh, he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
 The eyes are bright, he couldn’t wait to get away
```ANNOTATION:```
>They finally found out about each other's feeling, so he was ready and eager to go on a date with her; he couldn't wait to go away with her, both of their eyes were bright; symbolize a great feeling of love

 ## Do Me a Favour
Do Me a Favour Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, the mourning was complete
When there was tears on the steering wheel dripping on the seat
Several hours or several weeks
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak

[Verse 2]
It's the beginning of the end
The car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
Ask anyone, they'll tell you that it's these times that it tends
To start to break in half, to start to fall apart, hold on to your heart
[Chorus]
And do me a favour and break my nose
Or do me a favour and tell me to go away
Or do me a favour and stop asking questions

[Verse 3]
As she walked away, well, her shoes were untied
And the eyes were all red, you could see that we'd cried
And I watched and I waited till she was inside
Forcing a smile and waving goodbye
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold

[Chorus]
Do me a favour and ask if you need some help
She said, "Do me a favour and stop flattering yourself"
And to tear apart the ties that bind
Perhaps "fuck off" might be too kind
Perhaps "fuck off" might be too kind60Embed
#### Curiosity becomes a heavy load
 Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
```ANNOTATION:```
>Wondering "what if" and being curious can push relationships to the point where it is too heavy to hold, or in other words, cannot go on anymore. This curiosity could be in two ways - 

1.) A person may be curious of infidelity, lies, and unknowns, of which could be too much to handle.
2.) A person could be experiencing "what if" moments, and they may think that the grass is greener on the other side. 

The common theme here is unknowns, and these unknowns can destroy a relationship.



#### And the eyes were all red, you could see that we’d cried
```ANNOTATION:```
>Using "we" here emphasizes the narrator's regret and ambivalence about the break-up, as both parties were crying by the end.



#### And I watched and I waited till she was inside
 Forcing a smile and waving goodbye
```ANNOTATION:```
>This might show how our narrator could've wanted to seem stronger than he actually was. It also shows that he may have wanted to be the bigger man, but failed once it shows that he finds it difficult to break up with his partner after their relationship is falling apart.



#### As she walked away, well, her shoes were untied
```ANNOTATION:```
>Perhaps indicating that the singer's partner is leaving (after an argument or whatever) so quickly, all of a sudden, that they don't even take the time to tie their shoes.



#### Curiosity becomes a heavy load
 Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold
```ANNOTATION:```
>Wondering "what if", will drive the relationship to the brink. The narrator acknowledges that it's dangerous to wonder what life would be like if you had made different personal choices.



#### And to tear apart the ties that bind
 Perhaps “fuck off” might be too kind
 Perhaps “fuck off” might be too kind
```ANNOTATION:```
>Our narrator feels guilty and still likes his ex. He feels so guilty for tearing apart their binds and being responsible for the breakup that he doesn't think her telling him to 'fuck off' would be enough punishment - it would be too kind.

Since the full sentence is 'Fuck off' would be too kind _to break the ties between them_, this is actually a sort of backwards compliment as well - it shows they were really close and had a really tight connection. The backwards compliment is deliberate as it reflects the way he is feeling about her and their relationship as a whole now it has ended and he's heartbroken - it was amazing and they had a tight bond, but he's really annoyed about that now its over and it hurts him so much.



#### She said, “Do me a favour and stop flattering yourself”
```ANNOTATION:```
>She clearly feels that the narrator is to blame for the relationship falling apart.

Regarding the previous line, she thinks that he feels his powers are so great, he can help her with anything. This makes her realize how self-centered he is.



#### Do me a favour and ask if you need some help
```ANNOTATION:```
>The narrator wants the girl to ask if he's feeling okay, presumably so that gives him a good platform to explain why he isn't happy in the relationship.



#### And do me a favour and break my nose
 Or do me a favour and tell me to go away
 Or do me a favour and stop asking questions
```ANNOTATION:```
>The relationship has gotten so strained that he just wishes that his partner would show some kind of gesture that would end the relationship.

He would rather have an immediate physical pain, rather than a lingering heartache. He wants a reason to leave her without looking back.

#### It’s the beginning of the end
 The car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
 Ask anyone, they’ll tell you that it’s these times that it tends
 To start to break in half, to start to fall apart, hold on to your heart
```ANNOTATION:```
>The relationship he is in isn't working out. To "drive someone round the bend" is a British idiom meaning to irritate somebody. The narrator's partner is grating on his nerves and the relationship is falling apart because of it.

 ## This House is a Circus
This House is a Circus Lyrics[Verse 1]
This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk, though
Look what it's done to your friends
Their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk, though
Look what it's done to your friends
Their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
[Verse 2]
There's a room full of trouble and there's lovers to be had
Those ones who make sinners out of such lovely lads
Scaling the corridors for maidens in the maze
And the anomaly is slipping into familiar ways

[Chorus]
And we're forever unfulfilled and can't think why
Like a search for murder clues in dead men's eyes
Forever unfulfilled and can't think why
Like a search for murder clues in dead men's eyes

[Bridge]
The more you open your mouth, the more you're forcing performance
And all the attention is leading me to feel important
(Give me obnoxious, give me obnoxious now)
Now that we're here, we may as well go too far

[Verse 3]
Wriggling around in incidents you won't forget
There's certainly some venom in the looks that you collect
Aimlessly gazing at the faces in the kiln
And we're struggling with the notion that it's life, not film

[Verse 4]
This house is a circus, berserk as fuck (We're forever unfulfilled)
We tend to see that as a perk, though (Can't think why)
Look what it's done to your friends
Their memories are pretend (Like a search for murder clues)
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end14Embed
#### Aimlessly gazing at the faces in the kiln
 And we’re struggling with the notion that it’s life, not film
```ANNOTATION:```
>When he "aimlessly gazes" at the queues waiting outside the concert hall, he's having a hard time to differ the reality (life) from a movie (film), as it all seems unreal and maybe even further people start loosing grasp on what's real and what's entertainment.



#### (Give me obnoxious, give me obnoxious now)
```ANNOTATION:```
>People paying attention to him is making him not feel like a bother to the others around him possibly, though he probably still is. Also, this line is sung by the drummer Matt Helders rather than the actual singer.



#### Like a search for murder clues in dead men’s eyes
```ANNOTATION:```
>Though the hunt for getting a real feeling from all these antics is a pointless endeavor. Alex Turner compares this as to looking for clues in murder case in the victims eyes, which will reveal nothing.



#### Scaling the corridors for maidens in the maze
```ANNOTATION:```
>The opposite sex is doing the same thing, looking for the sweet girls to turn them into hoes.



#### The more you open your mouth, the more you’re forcing performance
 And all the attention is leading me to feel important
```ANNOTATION:```
>When it comes to impressing girls at a party, Alex is an idiot. As stated in ["Still Take You Home"](http://rapgenius.com/Arctic-monkeys-still-take-you-home-lyrics), ["You Probably Couldn't See For The Lights But You Were Staring Right At Me"](http://rapgenius.com/Arctic-monkeys-you-probably-couldnt-see-for-the-lights-but-you-were-staring-right-at-me-lyrics) and ["Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor"](http://rapgenius.com/Arctic-monkeys-i-bet-you-look-good-on-the-dancefloor-lyrics), Alex can get very desperate when it comes to trying to get a girl's attention and often makes a fool out of himself. The "performance" being forced is the act he puts on whenever he gets just a little bit of attention in an effort to gain more from her. He's probably making fun of someone or hitting on another girl or doing something obnoxious to make her laugh.

This girl along with the power of alcohol is making Alex's ego swell.



#### Now that we’re here, we may as well go too far
```ANNOTATION:```
>The party-goers are digging their selves deeper and deeper into this hole of a dangerous and empty lifestyle. By the time they realize it, all hope of steering back onto the right track will fly out the window and they'll just keep partying harder 'cause by now, they got nothing to lose.

This is a twist on a common rationalisation for sex - "Now that we're kissing, we may as well go all the way." It rarely ends well.



#### And we’re forever unfulfilled and can’t think why
```ANNOTATION:```
>The teenagers are bored and lead empty lives and instead of going out trying to achieve something or finding purpose or substance in it, they behave recklessly and immaturely only worsening their self-worth and sense of value. 

They drink, do drugs, smoke, behave sexually promiscuously and have sex for the sake of it because they can't think of anything better to do with their lives. 

This also shows how little they think of themselves as they don't believe they deserve anything better than sleeping with somebody they don't care about or doing drugs to distract themselves. They put themselves in harms way trying to find what they are missing but what they are looking for cannot be found at the bottom of a bottle.

https://images.genius.com/898c431885212b225117488a493ca6ae.620x372x1.jpg
This line compares the recklessness of the youth to the greed expressed in the music industry.



#### There’s a room full of trouble and there’s lovers to be had
 Those ones who make sinners out of such lovely lads
```ANNOTATION:```
>In places like this, it doesn't take much to turn your everyday sheep into wolves. Drink, drugs and easy woman for the taking can deceive and make sensibility seem asinine (paradoxical as it may seem).



#### Their memories are pretend
 And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
```ANNOTATION:```
>The partygoers are losing touch with reality due to drugs, alcohol and probably pure denial.

After the party, the friends begin to bullshit others and themselves idealised everything and making it all sound like a very big deal. In reality, they were probably very unglamorous - stammering around, slurring words, throwing up and so forth - but they've managed to convince themselves that the night did not go like this at all and that it was instead incredible.

https://images.genius.com/0a350bc0eca0c9afc7e9af3a6cb5319c.613x535x1.jpg

Even though in reality the night was a bust, the rush or buzz or high of the night or of the hype after it (e.g. people talking about it at school/work on Monday) makes them want to repeat the whole thing all over again. They want to cling to the feeling no matter how damaging the way one may persist to smoke regardless of the health effect. This combination of alcohol and drugs to warp the memories, as well as the pure need for the nights to be wild and astounded for them to validate themselves and give their actions meaning has made this situation addictive and desirable, but also extremely harmful.



#### We tend to see that as a perk, though
 Look what it’s done to your friends
```ANNOTATION:```
>Everyone - teenagers in particular - strive to have an exciting life so the idea of the house and the party being wild seems beneficial and cool at first, however in reality this chaos is not. They brag about parties and how much they drank, smoked or engaged in sexual activity and rewrite the events in their minds to make them seem impressive and even convince themselves that this is the truth.

http://images.genius.com/0fa3775cf27c716fd9ee0055d1b2f9c3.245x281x29.gif

Still, the mayhem of the party has negative consequences and Alex urges the party goers to look at the impact it has had on their friends. They are probably behaving not only irresponsibly but embarrassingly and shamefully. It has altered their perception of reality as they believe the next day that they had a wonderful night when they were probably miserable, drunk, unattractive and poorly put together by the end of the night.

The criticism towards the music industry seen in this line is similar to the one seen in ["Who The Fuck Are The Arctic Monkeys?:"](http://genius.com/840390)

>But your heroes ain't what they seem
When you've been where we've been

 ## If You Were There, Beware
If You Were There, Beware Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you were there, beware the serpent soul pinchers
Three-hundred and fifty "No, thank you"s and nobody flinches
Go on, girl, go on, give us something gruesome
We require your grief, the thugs help the thieves
As they're trying to rob the words from her gob and
Take the swords to the innocents

[Verse 2]
If you were there, beware the serpent soul pinchers
Can't you sense she was never meant to fill column inches
Ain't you had enough? What you're trying to dig up
Isn't there to be dug; the thieves help the thugs
As they're trying to beat the good grace of a sweetheart
Out to the point she'll comply
[Bridge]
And why leave her on her own?
If I'd have known then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it if I would have known
Why leave her on her own?
If I predicted tears then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it if I would have known

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
There's a circle of witches, ambitiously vicious they are
And our attempts to remind them of reason won't get us that far
But I don't know what it is that they want
I don't know what it is that they want
But I haven't got it to give
And she hasn't got it to give16Embed
#### Out to the point she’ll comply
```ANNOTATION:```
>Alex compares the girl's treatment to torture. Torture is often used to force a confession out of a victim and that's what's happening here. The media are being so persistent with her in hopes that she'll break and come out with a story, true or not, to make them leave



#### As they’re trying to beat the good grace of a sweetheart
```ANNOTATION:```
>As mentioned before, the girl is too innocent for this kind of drama. They can try, but the papaparazzi will not find a bad bone in her 



#### The thieves help the thugs
```ANNOTATION:```
>All these awful people are helping each other and working together to do wrong. It's all one big scheme and all the wicked people are ganging up against the victim (in this case it's believed to be Alexa, Alex's ex-girlfriend).



#### If you were there, beware the serpent soul pinchers
```ANNOTATION:```
>If you have a relationship with a celebrity (if you were there), the paparazzi and the media will go after you. Calling them 'serpent soul pinchers' highlights how wicked and how cruel the media can truly be. They are snakes, slimy and sly that steal people's 'soul' or 'identity'. Meaning they take people and twist them to fit what looks good in the paper.



#### The thugs help the thieves
```ANNOTATION:```
>Sometimes people close to celebs will sell them out for a cash. These people are the thugs that help the paparazzi steal a celeb's privacy

Additionally, in their attempts to get juicy information the media are "thick as theives".



#### As they’re trying to rob the words from her gob and
 Take the swords to the innocents
```ANNOTATION:```
>They're trying to force the girl into saying something that will make her out to be some sort of out of control girlfriend. But she's none of that. She's an innocent girl.



#### And our attempts to remind them of reason won’t get us that far
```ANNOTATION:```
>They can try to talk them out of it but it won't work. They can try to persuade them into giving mercy and even try to use guilt to get them to stop but they won't. They will stop at nothing.



#### There’s a circle of witches, ambitiously vicious they are
```ANNOTATION:```
>Alex is portraying the reporters as witches, surrounding an innocent victim right before they go in for the kill.
http://images.genius.com/429b10451c7919c82dc15b974a8293bf.1000x647x1.jpg



#### And why leave her on her own?
 If I’d have known then I wouldn’t have said it
 I wouldn’t have said it if I would have known
 Why leave her on her own?
 If I predicted tears then I wouldn’t have said it
 I wouldn’t have said it if I would have known
```ANNOTATION:```
>Alex must have accidentally let some information slip to reporters, that led them to pursue his girlfriend. Now, watching them attack her, to the point of driving her to tears, he wishes that he could just take back his words.

Now, he feels all the more guilty for not being there to support her through all of the ensuing stress ("leav[ing] her on her own").



#### What you’re trying to dig up
 Isn’t there to be dug;
```ANNOTATION:```
>The reporters are probably looking for some kind of scandal. Alex's girlfriend isn't like that. Their relationship is too stable to provide suspense for their fans. The reporters aren't gonna find any proof of her cheating or being a gold digger because she isn't.

 ## The Bad Thing
The Bad Thing Lyrics[Chorus]
Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it that much easier
It might make it worse

[Verse 1]
Oh, the night's like a whirlwind
Somebody's girlfriend's talking to me, but it's alright
She's saying that he's not gonna slap me or try to attack me
He's not the jealous type
And I only need to get half an excuse and I'm away
But when there's no excuses, that's much easier to say
I've been before
And all these capers make us too good for her to ignore
See, she's talking but I'm not entirely sure
[Chorus]
Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it that much easier
It might make it worse

[Verse 2]
Oh, a sudden disheartener
Somebody's partner's talking to me
But I don't know that is what she isn't
She murmurs things to confirm that the tragedy is true
And I knew, how could she not? She could have anyone she wants
And I'm struggling to think of an immediate response
Like, "I don't mind, it'd be a big mistake for you to wait
And let me waste your time
Really, love, it's fine"
I said, "Really, love, it's fine"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
And then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy
I knew before the invitation that there was this ploy
Oh, but she carried on suggesting, a struggle to refuse
She said, "It's the red wine this time," but that is no excuse10Embed
#### And then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy
```ANNOTATION:```
>For the first time Alex realises that if he goes through with having some form of relationship with this girl, that it could potentially destroy her relationship with someone else. He is now aware of the effects that his actions will have on this girl and her life.



#### And all these capers make us too good for her to ignore
```ANNOTATION:```
>The definition of ***'caper'*** is:
**an illicit or ridiculous activity or escapade.**
*or*
**a playful skipping movement.**

Essentially she is carrying on flirting with him and being very playful and very forward. Alex - understandably - finds it extremely hard to ignore all her shameless flirting because she is very beautiful and very, very eager. Even though he knows it may be wrong, his will power is fading and he can't over look her enthusiasm.

http://images.rapgenius.com/9fe0973911f7263e9e0c23befbde932a.460x250x1.jpg



#### I’ve been before
```ANNOTATION:```
>He's been down this road before, he knows exactly what is going on and what happens next.



#### Somebody’s girlfriend’s talking to me, but it’s alright
 She’s saying that he’s not gonna slap me or try to attack me
 He’s not the jealous type
```ANNOTATION:```
>Alex begins to talk to a girl here only to find out that she has a boyfriend. However, she convinces him that her boyfriend won't mind since he isn't the **jealous type**. Alex of course is not comforted by this, as he finds it hard to imagine that this interaction won't get him into trouble. Hitting on someone's girlfriend is of course the easiest way to get beat up in a bar.



#### Like, ”I don’t mind, it’d be a big mistake for you to wait
 And let me waste your time
 Really, love, it’s fine”
 I said, “Really, love, it’s fine”
```ANNOTATION:```
>Alex is hesitating with his opportunity to help this girl cheat on her man and he's saying that he'll understand if the girl loses his patience and finds another guy instead.



#### Do the bad thing
 Take off your wedding ring
 But it won’t make it that much easier
 It might make it worse
```ANNOTATION:```
>This song is about couples going to parties/clubs and cheating on their partners. Some people take off their wedding rings, to pretend to potential partners than they're single, and because looking at it might make them feel guilty.

However, the narrator warns that removing the ring might in fact make the affair harder, perhaps because the act of removing it itself makes them feel guilty for intentionally seeking to cheat. Moreover, leaving behind a ring for their partner to find might incriminate them.

 ## Old Yellow Bricks
Old Yellow Bricks Lyrics[Verse 1]
Old yellow bricks, love's a risk
Quite the little escapologist
Looked so miffed when you wished
For a thousand places better than this
You are the fugitive but you don't know what you're running from
You can't kid us and you couldn't trick anyone
Houdini, love, you don't know what you're running away from

[Chorus]
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?
[Verse 2]
She was enraged by the way
That the emperor were trapped in the cage
And the days she deemed dull
Leading to nights reading beer bottles
You're such a fugitive but you don't know what you're running from
You can't kid us and you couldn't trick anyone
Houdini, love, you don't know what you're running away from

[Chorus]
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

[Verse 3]
You're at a loss just because
It wasn't all that you thought it was
You are the fugitive but you don't know what you're running away from
She said, "I want to sleep in the city that never wakes up
And revel in nostalgia"
I know I said, "Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?"
But Dorothy was right though59Embed
#### I know I said, “Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?”
```ANNOTATION:```
>She's changed her mind and matured a bit. She has realized she was wrong and that, well there's no place like home (heard in the following line). She has had a change of heart since the start of the song and now decided she doesn't care how dull her home town may seem it is home and that's where she belongs. Thus, resolving the story and the song.



#### Love, you don’t know what you’re running away from
```ANNOTATION:```
>She is trying to escape and run away from something but she is clueless to what it is. She's running away for the sake of running away, but doesn't realize what she has left behind in doing so; friends, family etc.

Calling her *'love'* in this context also helps building on the character as a very, young and naïve girl. She is sweet enough, but rather childish and immature. He's talking to her like a very wise and calm adult talking to a frantic child.

Think of the *Wizard of Oz*, when Dorothy firsts runs away and 'Oz' tries to get her to return home.



#### You can’t kid us and you couldn’t trick anyone
```ANNOTATION:```
>The protagonist is trying to pretend they know what they want and what they don't but really they are ignorant. They are oblivious to what they have left behind and where they are headed and it's completely obvious.



#### She said, ”I want to sleep in the city that never wakes up
 And revel in nostalgia”
```ANNOTATION:```
>Now that she's away from home and realized it's not everything it's cracked up to be, she wishes to be at home in her own bed and to once again enjoy the place where she's from.

"The city that never wakes up" is a contrast to the usual big-city concept of "the city that never sleeps" (usually used to refer to New York).

http://images.rapgenius.com/43e551a79d59315690d42cda6de94a86.640x427x1.jpg



#### But Dorothy was right though
```ANNOTATION:```
>###*There's no place like home*

Towards the end of Wizard Of Oz, Dorothy realizes that she wants to go back home. She repeats this to herself as she taps her boots with her eyes closed and when she opens them, she's back at her home in Kansas. 
http://images.rapgenius.com/03ee5bd37045688a718bbe7ba2a0dbe1.460x276x1.jpg

You can go to the greatest cities on earth but it won't compare to where you were born and raised.



#### You’re at a loss just because
 It wasn’t all that you thought it was
```ANNOTATION:```
>Previous lines state "nostalgia" - it is quite likely that the journey this allegorical Dorothy is on happens *after* the initial rebellion of her youth. (Perhaps not old now, but *older* than she was when she planned her escape, which has now been realised to an extent.) 

When she was younger she had high expectations for all that she would accomplish in later years; now that those years are in the past, she's disappointed at the outcome of her life.



#### And the days she deemed dull
 Leading to nights reading beer bottles
```ANNOTATION:```
>With nothing to do and nowhere to go, she just stays home and gets drunk by herself. Fooking boring, tbr.



#### She was enraged by the way
 That the emperor were trapped in the cage
```ANNOTATION:```
>A shot at Mom or Dad; her parents found ways to try to make her stay at home, most likely financially based. This makes her angry, as she wants the ability to flee. Works nicely when put beside the next line about drinking, a common rebellious act teens use to defy their parents.



#### Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?
 Blinded by nostalgia
 Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?
```ANNOTATION:```
>This is most likely an inversion of the lyrics of Frank Sinatra song ["New York, New York,"](https://genius.com/Frank-sinatra-new-york-new-york-lyrics) in which Sinatra sings
>New York, New York
I wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap

New York City is said to be the city that never sleeps - but what if it's the opposite, one that never truly wakes up? Who would wanna live in a town like that? Sure, you have your memories of being raised there and all your friends you grew up with but is it really enough?

 ## 505
505 Lyrics[Chorus]
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

[Verse 1]
Stop and wait a sec
When you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked
[Verse 2]
Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

[Chorus]
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with "Goodbye"
I'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

[Chorus]
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs and a smile289Embed
#### It seems like once again you’ve had to greet me with “Goodbye”
```ANNOTATION:```
>Refers to the unexpected way in which his encounter with this girl ends abruptly due to some of Alex's issues with the relationship, once they met she "greets him with a goodbye."

Also it may refer to the small amount of time he gets to spend with this girl due to the fact that "rockstar" life doesn't give you enough space for your personal life. The moment spent with her flies away quickly and it seems like once again she has to "greet him with a goodbye."



#### And a smile
```ANNOTATION:```
>Goes along with the chorus. When Alex imagines going back to 505, he imagines his girl waiting for him. When the girl sees Alex she will have a smile on her face which will show that she is happy to see him.
This ending of the song leaves the listener with a certain feeling of hope.  A smile; which can be interpreted in many, many different ways.



#### Not shy of a spark
```ANNOTATION:```
>He and/or his lover are very lively, and can easily be evoked into a fight or into love.

This line makes most sense when one considers the ["Relationship As Chemistry"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry_%28relationship%29) metaphor.



#### The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start
```ANNOTATION:```
>Since they are not starting their relationship from the beginning but resuming what they had, he's trying to convince her to resume the relationship while also possibly aware that it will all end in pain and suffering.



#### When you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect?
```ANNOTATION:```
>She has him madly in love. The looks she gives him are enough to make him see past any of her flaws. http://images.rapgenius.com/5e0e744542428ce228f6be3607c9f2ea.400x214x26.gif



#### Frightened by the bite, though it’s no harsher than the bark
```ANNOTATION:```
>This line follows from the previous, revealing that the manner in which he would "fall short" (or fail) would be in fearing violence, though that violence (bite) isn't any worse that verbal altercation. This is revision of the idiom "x's bark is worse than their bite." The relationship between the speaker and his woman is one where verbal disagreements and physical roughness are equal in value.

#### The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
```ANNOTATION:```
>One can imagine the two excruciating situations described in this line: you are stabbed, the knife inside you and it's twisted--easily worse than pouring salt on a wound... But not worse than falling short of the mark, or failing and not measuring up to someone's standards--disappointing them and leading to abandonment.



#### But I crumble completely when you cry
```ANNOTATION:```
>The song takes a sharp turn here with very evocative lines. The care and pain he is feeling is now immensely displayed, both in tone and lyrics. He can't stand to see her cry, it kills him to see her sad.



#### I’m always just about to go and spoil the surprise
 Take my hands off of your eyes too soon
```ANNOTATION:```
>People put their hands over people's eyes when they have prepared a surprise for them; Alex has but as usual messes it up by giving the game away. Could this be what triggered their fight?

This could also be alluding to the fact that Alex has cheated on his girl and has tried to ease his girl into the breakup. This also hints back to the line "...the knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark" as Alex is worried that he is going to hurt this girl, which will be painful to him.



#### I’d probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
 Or I did last time I checked
```ANNOTATION:```
>Even if she was choking him, he wouldn't hold it against her--either because he's extremely devoted, sexually turned on, or because he knew he probably had it coming. And apparently, one of these things happened before and he still loves her then and now.
