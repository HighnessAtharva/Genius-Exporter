 ## Gotta Get Up
Gotta Get Up Lyrics[Chorus]
Gotta get up, gotta get out
Gotta get home before the morning comes
What if I'm late, got a big day
Gotta get home before the sun comes up
Up and away, got a big day, sorry can't stay
I gotta run run, yeah
Gotta get home, pick up the phone
Gotta let the people know I'm gonna be late

[Verse 1]
There was a time when we could dance until a quarter to ten
We never thought it would end then
We never thought it would end
We used to carry on and drink and do the rock and roll
We never thought we'd get old, though
We never thought we'd grow cold, but now
[Chorus]
Gotta get up, gotta get out
Gotta get home before the morning comes
What if I'm late, got a big day
Gotta get home before the sun comes up
Up and away, got a big day, sorry can't stay
I gotta run run, yeah
Gotta get home, pick up the phone
Gotta let the people know I'm gonna be late

[Verse 2]
Down by the sea she knew a sailor who had been to war
She never even knew a sailor before
She never even knew his name
He'd come to town and he would pound her for a couple of days
And then he'd sail across the bubbly waves
And those were happier days, but now

[Chorus]
Gotta get up, gotta get out
Gotta get home before the morning comes
What if I'm late, got a big day
Gotta get home before the sun comes up
Up and away, got a big day, sorry can't stay
I gotta run run, yeah
Gotta get home, pick up the phone
Gotta let the people know I'm gonna be late3Embed

 ## Driving Along
Driving Along Lyrics[Verse 1]
Driving along you can see all the people
Who seem to have nothing to say to each other
Each day they grow farther and farther away from each other

[Verse 2]
Driving along you can spot all the problems
On faces so tired of facing each other
Each day they grow farther and farther away from each other

[Bridge]
Driving along at fifty seven thousand miles an hour
Look at those people standing on the petals of a flower
Look at those petals pumping for a little bit of power
[Verse 3]
Driving along you can see all the people
Who seem to have nothing to say to each other
Each day they grow farther and farther away from each other

[Outro]
They seem to say nothing
They seem to go nowhere
They seem to go farther
They seem to go nowhere
They seem to go farther
They seem to go nowhere
They seem to go farther
And farther and farther
And farther and farther
And farther and farther
And farther and farther
And farther and farther
And farther away from each otherEmbed

 ## Early in the Morning
Early in the Morning Lyrics[Verse 1]
Early in the morning and I can't do right
Had a little fight with my baby last night and it's early in the morning

[Chorus]
Don'chu know it's early in the morning
Early in the morning
I ain't got nothing, no nothing but the blues

[Verse 2]
I went to your girlfriend's house
But she was out
I knocked on your daddy's door
But he began to shout and he said
It's early in the morning
[Chorus]
Don'chu know it's early in the morning
Early in the morning
I ain't got nothing, no nothing but the blues

[Verse 3]
I went to Dooby Chase to get somethin' to eat
Waitress looked at me said, "Harry, you sure look beat"
And I said, It's early in the morning

[Outro]
Don'chu know it's early in the morning
Early in the morning
Early in the morning
Early in the morning
Early in the morning
Early in the morning
Early in the morning
Early in the morning
Early in the morning
Ain't got nothing, but the
Ain't got nothing, but the
Ain't got nothing, but the
Ain't got nothing, but the
Ain't got nothing, but the
Ain't got nothing, but the
BluesEmbed

 ## The Moonbeam Song
The Moonbeam Song LyricsHave you ever watched a moonbeam
As it slid across your windowpane
Or struggled with a bit of rain
Or danced about the weathervane
Or sat along a moving train
And wondered where the train has been

Or on a fence with bits of crap
Around its bottom
Blown there by a windbeam
Who searches for the moonbeam
Who was last seen
Looking at the tracks
Of the careless windbeam
Or moving to the tracks
Of the tireless freight train
And lighting up the sides
Of the weathervane
And the bits of rain
And the windowpane
And the eyes of those
Who think they saw what happened
Have you ever watched a moonbeam
As it slid across your windowpane
Or struggled with a bit of rain
Or danced about the weather vane
Or sat along a moving train
And wonder where the train has been?

Looking at the tracks
Of the careless windbeam
Or moving to the tracks
Of the tireless freight train
And lighting up the sides
Of the weathervane
And the bits of rain
And the windowpane
And the eyes of those
Who think they saw what happenedEmbed

 ## Down
Down LyricsWell you gotta have soap to wash your sins away
You gotta have hope it's the price you gotta pay
You gotta give love or your love will walk away
And you gotta stay loose it's the only way to stay
Down, you got it going
Going 'round, you got it going
Down, da-da-down, da-da-down
Down to the bottom, to the bottom of a hole
Going down
Going down to the bottom, to the bottom of a hole
Going down
Down, you got it going
Going 'round, got it going
Down, going down, down, down
Going down to the bottom of a hole
Going down
I'm going down to the bottom, to the bottom of a hole
Going down
Down, you got it going
Going 'round, you got it going
Down, da-da-down, da-da-down
Down, you got it going
Going 'round, you got it going
Down
Down, you got it going
Going down you got me going
Going down
I'm going downEmbed

 ## Without You
Without You Lyrics[Verse 1]
No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

[Verse 2]
No, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know
[Chorus]
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore

[Verse 1]
Well, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

[Chorus]
Can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore

[Outro]
If living is without you...5Embed
#### You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows

 ## Coconut
Coconut LyricsBrother bought a coconut, he bought it for a dime
His sister had another one, she paid it for a lime
She put the lime in the coconut, she drank 'em both up
She put the lime in the coconut, she drank 'em both up
She put the lime in the coconut, she drank 'em both up

She put the lime in the coconut, she called the doctor
Woke him up and said, "Doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take
I say, doctor, to relieve this bellyache?
I say, doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take
I say, doctor, to relieve this bellyache?"
Now let me get this straight
You put the lime in the coconut, you drank 'em both up
You put the lime in the coconut, you drank 'em both up
Put the lime in the coconut, you drank 'em both up

Put the lime in the coconut, you called your doctor
Woke him up and said, "Doctor, ain't there nothing I can take
I said, Doctor, to relieve this bellyache?
I said, Doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take
I said, Doctor, to relieve this bellyache?"

You put the lime in the coconut, you drink 'em both together
Put the lime in the coconut, then you feel better
Put the lime in the coconut, drink 'em both up
Put the lime in the coconut, and call me in the morning

Whoo-whoo-whoo, whoo-ooh-ooh, whoo-ooh-ooh
Whoo-whoo-whoo, whoo-ooh-ooh, whoo-ooh-ooh
Whoo-whoo-whoo, whoo-ooh-ooh, whoo-ooh-ooh
Whoo-whoo-whoo, whoo-ooh-ooh, whoo-ooh-ooh

Brother bought a coconut, he bought it for a dime
His sister had another one, she paid it for a lime
She put the lime in the coconut, she drank 'em both up

And put the lime in the coconut, she called the doctor
Woke him up, said, "Doctor, ain't there nothing I can take
I said, Doctor, to relieve this bellyache?
I said, Doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take
I said, Doctor..."
Now let me get this straight
You put the lime in the coconut, you drink 'em both up
Put the lime in the coconut, you drink 'em both up
Put a lime in the coconut, you drink 'em both up

Put the lime in the coconut, you such a silly woman
Put a lime in the coconut and drink 'em both together
Put the lime in the coconut, then you feel better
Put the lime in the coconut, drink 'em both down
Put the lime in the coconut, and call me in the morning

Whoo-oo-oo-oo, ain't there nothin' you can take?
I say, whoo-oo-oo-oo, to relieve your bellyache?
You say, well, whoo-oo-oo-oo, ain't there nothing I can take?
I say, whoo-oo, to relieve your bellyache?
You say, yeah, ain't there nothin' I can take?
I say, waah waah, to relieve this bellyache?

I say, "Doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take?"
I say, "Doctor, ain't there nothing I can take?"
I say, "Doctor, ain't there nothing I can take?"
I say, "Doctor..."

You're such a silly woman
Put the lime in the coconut and drink them both together
Put the lime in the coconut, then you feel better
Put the lime in the coconut, drink 'em both up
Put the lime in the coconut, and call me in the mor-or-orning
Yes, you call me in the morning
If you call me in the morning, I'll tell you what to do
If you call me in the morning, I'll tell you what to do
If you call me in the morning, I'll tell you what to do
If you call me in the morning, I'll tell you what to do
Well, if you call me in the morning, I'll tell you what to do3Embed
#### Put the lime in the coconut, you called your doctor
```ANNOTATION:```
>It is unclear whether the sister called the doctor during business hours, or in the middle of the night. However, what is clear is the doctor is expressing consternation at having been woken – both through his words, and through his vengeful remedy.



#### Bellyache
```ANNOTATION:```
>The etiology of the abdominal pain is unclear, but could be due to the lime and the coconut, both the cause and the cure of this odd episode.

Jump into the Fire LyricsYou can climb a mountain
You can swim the sea
You can jump into the fire
But you'll never be free

You can shake me up
Or I can break you down
Whoa-o-o-o-, whoa-o-o-o-

We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy

We can make each other happy

 ## I’ll Never Leave You
I’ll Never Leave You LyricsSome nights I go to sleep without you
The river's far too deep without you
I can't make it alone, I need you by my side

Some nights I spend alone without you
The river's far too wide without you
I can't make it alone, I need you by my side

I'll never leave you alone
I'll never leave just a memory
I'll never leave you alone in the garden
Where nothing grows
I love you so much baby
I'll never leave you alone
I'll never leave just a memory
I'll never leave you alone in the garden
Where nothing grows
I love you so much babyEmbed

 ## Si no estás tú (Spanish Version of ”Without You”)
Si no estás tú (Spanish Version of ”Without You”) LyricsYo no puedo olvidarme, de tu cara al marcharte
Cuando nuestra triste historia terminó
Me sonreíste y a tus ojos el dolor
Se asomó, oh-ooh-oh

Cuando pienso en el futuro, veo todo tan oscuro
No sé por qué te dejé marchar
Y es necesario que te enteres sin tardar
De la verdad ah-aaah-ah

Vivir, no es vida si no estás tú
No podré existir sin tu amor
Vivir no es vida si no estas tú
No podré existir sin tu amor
Yo no puedo olvidarme, de tu cara al marcharte
Cuando nuestra triste historia terminó
Me sonreíste y a tus ojos el dolor
Se asomó; oh-ooh-oh

Can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymoreEmbed

 ## How Can I Be Sure Of You
How Can I Be Sure Of You LyricsThe other day a friend of mine said
He said, the sun's not really yellow
He said, the sun is really red
I said, my friend, what do you mean?
You read that in some magazine?
Next thing you'll say the earth's not green
How can I be sure of you?
When you know the world's always changing
Rearranging, always changing, changing
I said, my friend, how do you do
And what you're saying isn't true
The next thing you'll say the earth is blue
He said, my friend, you're in a dream
And things are never what they seem
Oh, things are never what they seem
How can I be sure anymore?
When the world's always changing
Rearranging, changingEmbed

 ## Old Forgotten Soldier
Old Forgotten Soldier LyricsReaching for a butterfly
Old soldiers never die
And the gun against their shoulder
Well, it gets a little older
And just like that old shoulder
It just gets put away

Well, I'm an old, forgotten soldier
Since they put an end to war
And I like to tell my story
But you don't wanna hear about the war
I'm an old, forgotten campaign hero
Left without a cause
Because they took away my wars
I'm an old, forgotten railroad
A broken, empty ammo-train
And my rusty ammunition
Has been left out in the rain

I'm an old, forgotten part-time doughboy
I tried to save the world
The world was round
We fired around
Heard all around the world

I'm an old, forgotten campaign hero
Left without a cause
Because, they took away my wars
I'm an old, forgotten railroad
A broken, lonely ammo-train
And my rusty ammunition
Has been left out in the rainEmbed
#### I’m an old, forgotten railroad
```ANNOTATION:```
>Five years earlier Nilsson released the song titled "Nobody cares about the railroads anymore"
