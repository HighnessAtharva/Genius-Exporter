We Like to Party! (The Vengabus) Lyrics[Intro]
We like to party
We like, we like to party
We like to party
We like, we like to party
We like to party
We like, we like to party
We like to party
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 1]
I've got something to tell ya
I've got news for you
Gonna put some wheels in motion
Get ready 'cause we're coming through (Coming through)
Hey now, hey now, hear what I say now
Happiness is just around the corner
Hey now, hey now, hear what I say now
We'll be there for you

[Chorus]
The Vengabus is coming
And everybody's jumping
New York to San Francisco
An intercity disco
The wheels of steel are turning
And traffic lights are burning
So if you like to party
Get on and move your body

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
We like to party
We like, we like to party
We like to party
We like, we like to party
[Verse 2]
Hey now, hey now, hear what I say now
Happiness is just around the corner
Hey now, hey now, hear what I say now
We'll be there for you

[Chorus]
The Vengabus is coming
And everybody's jumping
New York to San Francisco
An intercity disco
The wheels of steel are turning
And traffic lights are burning
So if you like to party
Get on and move your body

[Bridge]
We like to party
We like, we like to party
We like to party
We like, we like to party
We like to party
We like, we like to party
We like to party
We like, we like to party

The wheels of steel are turning
And traffic lights are burning
So if you like to party
Get on and move your body
The Vengabus is coming
And everybody's jumping
New York to San Francisco
An intercity disco
The wheels of steel are turning
And traffic lights are burning
So if you like to party
Get on and move your body

#### [Bridge]
```ANNOTATION:```
>a structure carrying a road, path, railway, etc. across a river, road, or other obstacle.
"a bridge across the River Thames"



#### [Instrumental Break]
```ANNOTATION:```
>This is distinguished from a breakdown, a section where the composition is deliberately deconstructed to hypothetical elements (usually the percussion or rhythm section with the vocal re-introduced over the hypothetical backing), all other parts having been hypothetically or suddenly cut out. The distinction between breaks and breakdowns may be described as, "Breaks are for the drummer; breakdowns are for electronic producers". In hip hop music and electronica, a short break is also known as a "cut", and the reintroduction of the full bass line and drums is known as a "drop", which is sometimes accented by cutting off everything, even the percussion right before the full music is dropped back in.



#### Get ready ’cause we’re coming through (Coming through)
```ANNOTATION:```
>The use of "Get Ready" makes the reader want to read on.



#### I’ve got news for you
```ANNOTATION:```
>The Vengaboys are again grabbing your attention by saying that they have news for you to recieve.



#### I’ve got something to tell ya
```ANNOTATION:```
>The Vengaboys are implying that they have a message that you need to know. Alternatively, they could be using this to grab your attention before telling you the "something" in question.



#### We like, we like to party
 We like to party
 We like, we like to party
 We like to party
```ANNOTATION:```
>Here, the Vengaboys are emphasising just how much they like to party. One might say they even "love" to party.



#### Happiness is just around the corner
```ANNOTATION:```
>Happiness is just around the corner, because the Vengabus is just around the corner.

The Vengabus brings happiness.



#### We like to party
 We like, we like to party
 We like to party
```ANNOTATION:```
>This is a haiku.



#### New York to San Francisco
```ANNOTATION:```
>New York to San Francisco is a long trip, and both big cities. This line means that the party won't stop anytime soon.



#### The wheels of steel are turning
```ANNOTATION:```
>This bus has wheels made of steel. Rubber is durable but steel is extremely strong. It can't be stopped.

 ## Up and Down
Up and Down Lyrics[Pre-Song]
We have already in the past produced records
These records were successful
And produced considerable results
But the funds have been spent
And very well spent
And for this reason we're
Now producing
A new, unique record
Called: Up and Down
[Verse 1]
Up and down
Up and down
And up and down
Up and down
Up and down
Up... and down

[Verse 2]
Up and down
Up and down
And up and down
Up and down
Up and down
Up and down
And up and down
And up and down
And up and down
And up and down
And up and down, and down, and down...
And up and down

Up and downEmbed
#### Up and down
```ANNOTATION:```
>A reference to the stock market, which the Vengaboys were famously involved in as a way to fund their outrageous party habits and trips to Ibiza. 

Can also be read as a metaphor for the volatility of life... and, ultimately, the futility of it, as we become stuck in a figurative cycle of highs and lows, never settling, and bringing on the familiar feeling of existential nausea.

This positions the Vengaboys as more Sartre than satire, contrary to popular belief.

 ## We’re Going To Ibiza!
We’re Going To Ibiza! Lyrics[Intro]
Hello, party people!
This is Captain Kim speaking
Welcome aboard Venga Airways
After take-off we'll pump up the sound system
'Cause we're going to Ibiza!

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be a bus driver​
All my life
I'm gonna pack my bags and leave this town
Grab a flight
Fly away on Venga Airways
Flyin' high, Ibiza sky
[Verse 2]
I look up at the sky
And I see the clouds
I look down at the ground
And I see the rain go down the drain
Fly away on Venga Airways
Flyin' high, Ibiza sky

[Chorus]
Whoa! We're going to Ibiza
Whoa! Back to the island
Whoa! We're gonna have a party
Whoa! In the Mediterranean Sea

[Post-Chorus]
Ioh ioh, oh we oh, oh we oh
Ioh ioh, oh we oh, oh we oh
Ioh ioh, oh we oh, oh we oh
Ioh ioh, oh we oh, oh we oh

[Verse 3]
Far away from this big town
And the rain
It's really very nice to be
Home again
Fly away on Venga Airways
Flyin' high, Ibiza sky
[Chorus]
Whoa! We're going to Ibiza
Whoa! Back to the island
Whoa! We're gonna have a party
Whoa! In the Mediterranean Sea

[Post-Chorus]
Ioh ioh, oh we oh, oh we oh
Ioh ioh, oh we oh, oh we oh
Ioh ioh, oh we oh, oh we oh
Ioh ioh, oh we oh, oh we oh

[Bridge]
Thank you for flying Venga Airways
We are now approaching Ibiza airport
As you can see, the sky is blue
And the beach is waiting for you

[Chorus]
Whoa! We're going to Ibiza
Whoa! Back to the island
Whoa! We're gonna have a party
Whoa! In the Mediterranean Sea
Whoa! We're going to Ibiza
Whoa! Back to the island
Whoa! We're gonna have a party
Whoa! In the Mediterranean Sea
[Outro]
Whoa! We're going to Ibiza!Embed

 ## Superfly Slick Dick
Superfly Slick Dick LyricsBig boy, showing off all around the city
Still the same for such a suite thinking you're so bad
Hustlin' girls, handy phone, acting like you're busy
Baby, let me tell you, you're the worst I ever had

Superfly, superfly
Superfly slick dick
Superfly, superfly
Superfly slick dick
Superfly, superfly
Superfly slick dick
Superfly, superfly
Superfly slick dick
Highbrow attitude, really don't impress me
I know where you're coming from, see right through your game
Luxury overdose won't make you possess me
Baby let me tell you, in the end it's all the same

Don't think I'm crying and trying to get
You out of my heart
No need denying that you have been lying
Right from the start
I thought this love would take us to the
Heights of sensuality
But now I know that you're not even half
The man you said you'd be
Don't think I'm crying and trying to get
You out of my heart
No need denying that you have been lying
Right from the start
I thought this love would take us to the
Heights of sensuality
But now I know that you're not even half
The man you said you'd be

Superfly, superfly

 ## All Night Passion
All Night Passion LyricsAllman Brothers Band, The
Where It All Begins
All Night Train
Last night sorta got so insane
As i went ridin' on the all night train
Took it down the street and around the block
Took it downtown baby where the big boys rock
Roll on, roll on
Take me where i can ease my pain
Preacher say boy now where you been?
Getting lead in my pockets
Putting money in sin
When the mornin' comes not a nickel to my name
Threw it all away on the all night train
Ride, let the passenger ride
Ride, let the passenger ride
I woke up late yesterday afternoon
My eyeballs feeling like two balloons
The doctor say things ain't never gonna change
Till you stop riding that all night train
Ride, let the passenger ride
Ride, let the passenger ride
Took a little trip to keep from going insane
Spent the rest of my life on the all night train
All night train
All night train
All night trainEmbed
