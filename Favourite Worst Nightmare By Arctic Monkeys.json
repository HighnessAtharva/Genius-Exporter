She could have anyone she wants\nAnd I'm struggling to think of an immediate response\nLike, \"I don't mind, it'd be a big mistake for you to wait\nAnd let me waste your time\nReally, love, it's fine\"\nI said, \"Really, love, it's fine\"\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy\nI knew before the invitation that there was this ploy\nOh, but she carried on suggesting, a struggle to refuse\nShe said, \"It's the red wine this time,\" but that is no excuse10Embed"
