 ## I Told You Everything
I Told You Everything LyricsSitting at the bar, I told you everything
You said, "Holy shit, you almost died"
Sharing a shot, you held my hand
Knowing everything, knowing everything, we cried
I told you everything about everything

I had no idea, I had no idea
We held hands, we held hands
We held hands as we parted
We knocked knees, we knocked knees as it started
I told you everything about my first time
I told you everything, no change in your eyes
I told you everything, no changing my mind

You said "Holy shit, we almost died"
I had no idea, I had no idea1Embed
#### You said “Holy shit, we almost died”
```ANNOTATION:```
>>That was more of a reflection after the fact, because we were friends starting out and we realized we had feelings for each other. And we decided to wait because we weren't ready. We were both in relationships that weren't healthy and we wanted to do the right things. But on that tour, we realized we had feelings for each other and we just talked about it, we didn't do anything about it, but we knew it was there. So we decided to just go home and see what that was like and revisit it later. So upon reflection of us first connecting, and going on tour, and disconnecting as people and friends. Just thinking about – it was a hard decision to decide to do that. To take that chance and let go of that person who I was with that I knew wasn't right, and to go with someone new, it was like woah. But I knew if I hadn't taken that leap, it wouldn't have happened.

—Sharon Van Etten, explaining the pronoun shift in an interview with [Aquarium Drunkard](https://aquariumdrunkard.com/2019/01/16/sharon-van-etten-the-ad-interview/)



#### Sitting at the bar, I told you everything
 You said, “Holy shit, you almost died”
```ANNOTATION:```
>>It was the first time I ever sat down with someone – and you know like you have those experiences where you're talking to a friend and you start telling this really intense story and you realize they haven't heard it before? And it's like, oh, well, okay. I'm going to tell you this story and it's going to take our friendship to the next level. Are you ready for that? I remember I was telling – at the time, he was my drummer, now he's my partner – we had just finished rehearsing for the Nick Cave tour and we were rehearsing all these songs as a duo. After practice one day, we went to a bar to talk about things – and I told him something about my past and realized I hadn't told him a certain story. It's one of those things I'm still learning how to tell friends, let alone in the public eye. And as I told him, I saw him change. He looked at me differently. Not in a belittling way, but like he knew me more. I took for granted that I hadn't told him this part of my life, but it definitely shaped the person I am today. And it brought us closer together. And I remember this moment in slow motion in my mind, just watching him receive this story with such love as a friend. And I'll never forget that.

—Sharon Van Etten, telling the story behind this line in an interview with [Aquarium Drunkard](https://aquariumdrunkard.com/2019/01/16/sharon-van-etten-the-ad-interview/)

 ## No One’s Easy to Love
No One’s Easy to Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yes, there were jerks recalling the years of love's past
As you opened the door and told me how you loved me so much
The resistance to feeling something that you put down before
But keep quiet of it as you could not face it anymore

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Too much has changed, I can’t let you walk in in the night
I wish away my love, leave with the dawn
Acting as if all the pain in the world was my fault
Leave me here, my love, don't say goodbye
[Chorus]
No one's easy to love
Don’t look down, my dear, don't be surprised
No one's easy to love
Don't look back, my dear, just say you tried

[Verse 2]
There was a question you asked, "Is your father a man?"
No, but I think you should do ask of yourself the same

[Pre-Chorus 2]
What is the difference between now and then? I'm not sure
Prove me wrong, my dear, don't say I lied

[Chorus]
No one's easy to love
Don't look down, my dear, don’t be surprised
No one’s easy to love
Don't look back, my dear, just say you triedEmbed
#### Yes, there were jerks recalling the years of love’s past
```ANNOTATION:```
>The press narrative behind Van Etten's debut album—an [emotionally abusive partner](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/singer-sharon-van-etten-on-escaping-abuse-w2wzlt3rb0b) who discouraged her from pursuing music—clings to her public profile even a decade later. It's easy to imagine that Van Etten has internalized this idea of herself as perpetually unlucky in love and remains skeptical of new relationships.

 ## Memorial Day
Memorial Day Lyrics[Verse 1]
Where do you always stay, where do you stay?
When you look, what do you see then?
Come back with your head up
When you barely stand, when you couldn't tell

[Chorus]
You, you will run (You will run)
You will run (You will run)
You will (You will)
You, you will run (You will run)
You will run (You will run)
You will (You will)
[Verse 2]
Back, you will stay
You will learn or you will do it again
Will you ever hold your ground?
Will I ever pull your teeth?
If you barely stand
How do I let you leave?

[Chorus]
You, you will run (You will run)
You will run (You will run)
You will (You will)
You, you will run (You will run)
You will run (You will run)
You will (You will)

[Outro]
Standing, I can see
You will run, you will runEmbed

 ## Comeback Kid
Comeback Kid Lyrics[Verse 1]
"Hey, you're the comeback kid"
See me look away, I'm the runaway
I'm the stay-out-late, I'm recovering
Kid at the top of our street
I was somewhat like him, I was somebody

[Chorus 1]
Comeback kid
Comeback kid
Come back, kid
Let me look at you
[Verse 2]
"Yeah, you're the comeback kid
Let me look at you"
Then look away
Yeah, I'm the runaway, I'm the hardly stay
Let slip away

[Chorus 2]
Don't look back
Don't look back
Don't look back
Watch me run away

[Bridge]
"Kid came back a real turn around"
Please believe that I want to stay
"Got a job now that my brother found
Working nights just a mile away"
Don't let me slip away, I'm not a runaway
It just feels that way

[Chorus 1]
Comeback kid
Comeback kid
Come back, kid
Let me look at you
Comeback kid
Comeback kid
Come back2Embed
#### “Hey, you’re the comeback kid”
 See me look away, I’m the runaway
 I’m the stay-out-late, I’m recovering
 Kid at the top of our street
 I was somewhat like him, I was somebody
```ANNOTATION:```
>This is about Van Etten's struggles in her private life. Although many may see her already making her comeback, she is still struggling with personal issues that are hidden because people don't know enough about her more than what they can see and assume.

 ## Jupiter 4
Jupiter 4 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Our love's for real
How'd it take a long, long time
To let us feel?
Try to relate in my state
And the aura around me says
My love is for real

[Verse 2]
Touching your face
How'd it take a long, long time
To be here?
Turning the wheel on my street
My heart still skips a beat
It's echoing, echoing, echoing, echoing, echoing, echoing
[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby
I've been searching for you
I want to be in love
Baby, baby, baby
I've been waiting, waiting, waiting my whole life
For someone like you
It's true that everyone would like to have met
A love so real
A love so real

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby
I've been searching for you
I want to be in love
Baby, baby, baby
I've been waiting, waiting, waiting my whole life
For someone like you
It's true that everyone would like to have met
A love so real
A love so real
A love so real
A love so real3Embed
#### I’ve been waiting, waiting, waiting my whole life
 For someone like you
```ANNOTATION:```
>someone like you, gentle, smart, handsome and strong; yet no one compares even if some do fit such description, because they are not you. could it be that every romance between two true lovers is unique, which is to say ordained?

 ## Seventeen
Seventeen Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know what you wanna say
I think that you're all the same
Constantly being led astray
You think you know something you don't

[Chorus 1]
Downtown hotspot halfway up the street
I used to be free, I used to be seventeen
Follow my shadow around your corner
I used to be seventeen, now you're just like me
[Verse 2]
Down beneath the ashes and the stone
Sure of what I've lived and have known
I see you so uncomfortably alone
I wish I could show you how much you've grown

[Chorus 2]
Downtown hotspot used to be on this street
I used to be seventeen, I used to be seventeen
Now you're a hotshot hanging on my block
Sun coming up, who's my shadow?

[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Bridge]
I know what you're gonna be
I know that you're gonna be
You'll crumble it up just to see
Afraid that you'll be just like me

[Chorus 3]
Downtown hotspot halfway through this life
I used to feel free, or was it just a dream?
Now you're a hotshot, think you're so carefree
But you're just seventeen, so much like me
You're just seventeen, you're just seventeen
Seventeen11Embed
#### Sure of what I’ve lived and have known
 I see you so uncomfortably alone
 I wish I could show you how much you’ve grown
```ANNOTATION:```
>Sharon talks to her own younger self, portraying the way she felt at that young age of 17, but also knowing the things that followed. She reflects on the things she has learned with age and feels the need to talk it to young Sharon, to end her uncomfortable feelings, to ensure her she will grow and become a full human being.

 ## Malibu
Malibu Lyrics[Verse 1]
We held hands as we passed the truck
Just a couple of dudes who don't give a fuck
Tap the brakes and we slow down
Just a couple of jokers on the edge of town
In Malibu

[Chorus]
In the little red car that don't belong to you
Yeah, that little red number
Driving down the road
[Verse 2]
I walked in the door
The Black Crowes playing as you cleaned the floor
I thought I couldn't love him any more

[Chorus]
In that little red number
Driving down the road
Yeah, that little red number
Driving down the road
In the little red car that don't belong to you
Yeah, that little red number
Driving down the road
In the little red car that don't belong to you
Yeah, that little red number
Driving down the roadEmbed
#### We held hands as we passed the truck
 Just a couple of dudes who don’t give a fuck
 Tap the brakes and we slow down
 Just a couple of jokers on the edge of town
```ANNOTATION:```
>Comparing these verses with ["Tarifa"](https://genius.com/Sharon-van-etten-tarifa-lyrics), another Sharon Van Etten song named after a town she traveled to, Drowned in Sound's Jasper Willems [offered](http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4152188-going-elemental--dis-meets-sharon-van-etten) the following interpretation:

>Unless we’re talking Springsteen, the tale of two runaways astray in some dust bowl doesn’t evoke the same immaculate romance as, maybe, the hued beach sunsets of Gibraltar. But ultimately, it’s a better analogy for what you’d call a healthy, pragmatic and long-lasting relationship. This sentiment is the gist of *Remind Me Tomorrow*: there is no smooth, panoramic glide over these treacherous emotional landscapes. Van Etten instead takes a king-sized four-wheel drive, grinding and seething her way through.



#### I walked in the door
 The Black Crowes playing as you cleaned the floor
 I thought I couldn’t love him any more
```ANNOTATION:```
>Sharon explained these verses in an [interview with Drowned in Sound](http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4152188-going-elemental--dis-meets-sharon-van-etten):

>The first half of the song was written when my (current) partner took me to Malibu for the first time. I finished the second half in New York. When I came home from the studio, I walked in the door and I saw him cleaning his bathroom in his pajama’s playing The Black Crowes. That was a special moment, because it became an actual story, a little vignette, and I don’t tend to write like that. It represented where I was at in my heart.

 ## You Shadow
You Shadow Lyrics[Verse 1]
Follow me until you don't know where you are
Follow me until you don't know where you are
Closing your eyes when you're reaching with hands
Falling down flat when you don't understand who I am

[Chorus]
You ain't nothing, you never won
You ain't nothing, you never done nothing, no
You don't do nothing I don't do, you shadow
[Verse 2]
Listen until you know what to say
Listen until you know what to say
Use loving words and be gentle and kind
Open your mind and it's easy to find where I am

[Chorus]
You ain't nothing, you never won
You ain't nothing, you never done nothing, no
You don't do nothing I don't do, you shadow
You ain't nothing, you never won
You ain't nothing, you never done nothing, no
You don't do nothing I don't do, you shadow

[Bridge]
You say that you've changed your mind, yeah, I let you
Your side isn't on my side, walking east now

[Chorus]
You ain't nothing, you never won
You ain't nothing, you never done nothing, no
You don't do nothing I don't do, you shadow
You ain't nothing, you never won
You ain't nothing, you never done nothing, no
You don't do nothing I don't do, you shadow
[Outro]
You don't do nothing I don't do, you shadow
You don't do nothing I don't do, you shadow
You don't do nothing I don't do, you shadowEmbed
#### Your side isn’t on my side, walking east now
```ANNOTATION:```
>When walking east during morning hours, your shadow is behind you. So Sharon might be saying that keeping an inescapable darkness (i.e. a shadow) out of view is necessary in order to walk toward the light (i.e. the sun).



#### You don’t do nothing I don’t do, you shadow
```ANNOTATION:```
>The namesake of the song recalls lyrics from "Seventeen" two tracks earlier:

"Follow my shadow around your corner
I used to be seventeen, now you're just like me"

and

"Now you're a hotshot hanging on my block
Sun coming up, who's my shadow?"

In "Seventeen", it's fairly clear that Sharon is referring to herself (specifically, her younger self) as "my shadow". Thus it is possible to make a similar interpretation here: perhaps Sharon is addressing negative voices within herself to "use loving words and be gentle and kind".

 ## Hands
Hands Lyrics[Verse 1]
Putting my hands up and following you
I know what I've done to you, I promise you

[Chorus]
Put your hands on your lover
I've got my hands up
Mean no harm to one another
Put your hands up

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling the changes
I know it's just like me to say
I wanna make sense of it all
We could handle anything when we were young
[Chorus]
Put your hands on your lover
I've got my hands up
Mean no harm to one another
Put your hands up
Put your hands on your lover
I've got my hands up
Mean no harm to each other
I've got my hands up

[Verse 3]
Right here describes you
I'm hearing your sighs sneaking out
And I wanted to tell you what you wanted to hear
But you told me to let it all out, dear

[Chorus]
Put your hands on your lover
I've got my hands up
Mean no harm to each other
I've got my hands up1Embed
#### Put your hands on your lover
 I’ve got my hands up
 Mean no harm to one another
 Put your hands up
```ANNOTATION:```
>given the statement released in an interview that the song was written after a domestic argument the chorus is mostly about the surrender and abandonment of petty arguments. The idea that hands can be used to signify peace, surrender and love is kind of beautiful



#### Putting my hands up and following you
```ANNOTATION:```
>the stance of hands in the air is symbolic of surrender. The idea that the singer is surrendering and following the subject indicates loss of power and submission.

 ## Stay
Stay Lyrics[Verse 1]
Have you all of my lifetime
Kinda hard to make light
Imagining when you were inside
When you made those kicks at night

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't wanna hurt you
Don't wanna run away from myself
Want your whole star to shine on in
One star, one light
The meaning of life
[Chorus]
You won't let me go astray
You will let me find my way

[Verse 2]
Find a way to stand
And a time to walk away
Letting go to let you lead
I don't know how it ends

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Comes a time when you answer
Do it with heart
Want you to express yourself
Not let it get to your head

[Chorus]
You won't let me go astray
You will let me find my way
You, you love me either way
You stay1Embed
#### Want you to express yourself
 Not let it get to your head
```ANNOTATION:```
>Sharon has emphasised that she wants to write and play her music for reasons of good: to express herself, as a form of therapy, and to help others.
She is afraid that when she doesn't know who her audience are, it will lose its meaning and become a form of self-indulgence, 'get to [her] head.' 
She wants this for other people, too - she has said she wants others to be able to find a way to truly express themselves. Most likely, she has this same fear for her son in particular - she wants him to live his life 'with heart', genuinely, without letting anything get to his head.



#### Imagining when you were inside
 When you made those kicks at night
```ANNOTATION:```
>Although these verses obviously refer to Van Etten's son, the song itself was initially written about her partner. [According to her](https://nylon.com/sharon-van-etten-interview):

>["Stay"] started off too as a love song to my partner, and I didn’t have all the lyrics done. I just had the chorus. I was working on lyrics, trying to be creative. It was toward the end of my pregnancy, and I’m starting to think of all the things that I want for [my son]. There had been a couple of times where I was writing lyrics, and I had this vision of a projector showing films of my child who wasn’t born yet, like running and looking to me. I think a lot of mothers feel that when they’re envisioning what’s about to happen. All I want is the best for him, regardless of what I’ve been through already in my life.
